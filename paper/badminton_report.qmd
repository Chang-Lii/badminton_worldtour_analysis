# Introduction {#sec-intro}

The research aims to answer the question: Does the number of points scored explain the variation in the number of wins in professional badminton? This question is significant because identifying the connection between scoring ability and match wins gives us a clear understanding of performance with players. The dataset is from the BWF World Tour (2018–2023). The simple linear regression model focuses on singles matches with wins as the response and total points scored as the predictor. In expectation that players who score more points will, on average, achieve more wins.

# Data {#sec-data}

The dataset contains information about 185 players who competed in the BWF World Tour from 2018–2023. There are 76 rows corresponds to a single player and includes overall performance indicators such as matches played, wins, and losses, as well as points scored, points against, and efficiency measures (win percentage and shot percentage).[@BWF_data]

# Methods {#sec-methods}

The linear regression analysis examines the relationship between the total number of wins the player had (Wins) and the key predictor - the total number of points scored by the player (pts_for). With this model, we are able to detect the impact of parameters on the total number of wins and obtain the association between them.

# Results {#sec-results}

### Interpret the model

The fitted simple linear regression model is:

$$
Wins_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot pts\_for_i + \varepsilon_i
$$

The scatter plot shows a strong positively linear relationship between wins and points scored (pts_for). Most points lie close to the regression line, however, as the values of pts_for increasing, some observations deviate from the regression line, indicates that the variability at the high performance level, this also reflects that most players have points concentrate between 0 to 500, only a few people have high performance in single matches.

The results of the linear regression analysis indicate that the number of wins is predicted by the point scored(pts_for). This model highlights the central role of scored performance in driving player's performance: As the number of points scored increases, it also tends to result in an average increase in the total number of wins.

### Estimate Coefficient

95% CI for $\beta_0$ is \[-1.28870213, -0.06415109\]\
95% CI for $\beta_1$ is \[0.01631484, 0.01740097\]

-   $\beta_0$: In the absence of any points scored, number of wins, on average, fall somewhere between -1.2887 and -0.0642\
-   $\beta_1$: For each 1 point scored by players, there will be an average increase in number of wins between 0.0163 and 0.0174 units.

The slope coefficient has an estimate of $\hat{\beta}_1 = 0.0169$ with a very small standard error of 0.00027, indicating that the estimate is very precise.

The t-statistic for the slope is 61.85 with a p-value \< $2.2 \times 10^{-16}$, indicating that the slope coefficient is highly significant. We reject the null hypothesis $H_0: \beta_1 = 0$, and conclude that $pts\_for$ has a strongly positive association with wins. The intercept has a t-statistic of -2.20 with a p-value of 0.031, suggesting it is statistically different from zero at the 5% level, although its practical interpretation is limited.

### R-Squared

| Model      | RSE   | R Square | Adjusted R Square | DF  |
|------------|-------|----------|-------------------|-----|
| $pts\_for$ | 2.164 | 0.981    | 0.9808            | 74  |

*Predictor:* $pts\_for$

RSE (Residual standard error) represents a typical distance between the observed values and the values predicted by the model. RSE = 2.164, which indicates that predictions are typically about 2.16 units away from the true values. This provides an absolute measure of lack of fit. Since the RSE is small, we can conclude that the predicted values $\hat{y}_i$ are approximately close to the true values $y_i$.

A very high $R^2 = 0.981$ indicates that the predictor accounts for approximately 98.1% of the variance in Wins and captures a large amount of explanatory power. This also suggests that around 98.1% of the variance of Wins is explained by the predictor in the model. Again, a high $R^2$ only reflects a good fit on the data; it does not imply the model is perfect.

### ANOVA

| Model      | Sum of Squares | DF  | Mean Square | F value | Pr(\>F)           |
|------------|----------------|-----|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| $pts\_for$ | 17916.4        | 1   | 17916.4     | 3825.8  | \< 2.2e-16 \*\*\* |
| Residuals  | 346.5          | 74  | 4.7         |         |                   |

The ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) test results reinforce the model's significance:\
The F-statistic of 3825.8 $\gg 1$ shows that variation explained by the predictor is far greater than residual variation, and the corresponding p-value (\< $2.2 \times 10^{-16}$) indicates that the model is highly statistically significant, meaning that the predictor ($pts\_for$) collectively has a meaningful relationship with Wins.

### Evaluation of Assumptions

![Residuals vs fitted values](pictures/res_vs_fit.png){fig-align="center"}

-   **Residuals vs fitted values**: The residuals are mostly concentrated at low fitted values (0–10). Additionally, as the fitted values increase beyond 20, the residuals show an increasing trend. This suggests that the linear regression model may not fully capture the relationship and there is a violation of the constant variance assumption.\

![Q-Q residuals](pictures/QQ.png){fig-align="center"}

-   **Q-Q residuals**: The residuals generally follow the theoretical quantile along the middle range; however, at the lower and upper tails, the points deviate from the theoretical quantile. This indicates that the residuals have heavy tails compared to the normal distribution, thus, normality is not fully satisfied.\

![Scale-location plot](pictures/scale_location.png){fig-align="center"}

-   **Scale-location plot**: The scale-location plot evaluates homoscedasticity. In this plot, we see a noticeable trend showing that variance of residuals increases as fitted values increase. Thus, this suggests a violation of the homoscedasticity assumption.\

![Residuals vs leverage](pictures/res_vs_leverage.png){fig-align="center"}

-   **Residuals vs leverage**: This plot detects outliers and influential observations. In this plot, three observations (such as 1, 27, and 67) lie close to or beyond the Cook’s distance contours. This shows that these observations have crucial impact on the regression model.

# Discussion {#sec-discussion}

This analysis answers the main question by showing that scoring ability has a strong and statistically significant association with wins in professional badminton singles matches. The main strength of the analysis is its high interpretability, as seen in the very considerable R\^2 and precise slope estimate. However, the obvious weaknesses include violation of the homoscedasticity, heavy-tailed residuals, and influential data points that may crucially affect the conclusion.

The transformations could be considered as one of the future works, additionally, including more predictors (e.g., a dummy variable for category differences between Singles and Doubles). Further research could also explore longitudinal performance trends across different years and tournaments.
